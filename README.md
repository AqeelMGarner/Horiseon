## Description
My motivation for building this webpage was to connect businesses to potential customers on the internet. I've build this webpage to help businesses increase their visibilty online, this will help bring new customers to the businesses also investors. What I've learnt is social media and the internet can give your businesses a bad reputation if lefted unchecked. This is a problem I've solved with Horiseon's webpage it gives more control back to businesses to handle their online presence.
